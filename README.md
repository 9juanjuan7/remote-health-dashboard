# remote-health-dashboard

We’re building a health data marketplace where people can upload their sensor data (like heart rate or movement) using our hardware. Instead of selling data one by one, everyone’s data gets grouped into big, anonymous bundles (called cohorts).

When a researcher buys a bundle, our system automatically tracks ownership and splits the payment among all contributors—so every user gets rewarded.

We use blockchain behind the scenes for fairness, transparency, and simple automated payouts—but users just see an easy web app, no crypto or wallets required.


#Simple User Flow for the Marketplace:

User signs up with Google.

User uploads health sensor data, or records using our hardware.

System automatically groups user’s data into a large, anonymous bundle with other users (a cohort).

A researcher browses available cohorts and buys one for research.

System tracks the sale and automatically splits the payment among all contributors in that bundle.

Each user gets a notification or dashboard update showing they earned a reward from the sale.

#All blockchain magic happens in the background—users just use a familiar web app and see their rewards!
