# remote-health-dashboard

We’re building a health data marketplace where people can upload their sensor data (like heart rate or movement) using our hardware. Instead of selling data one by one, everyone’s data gets grouped into big, anonymous bundles (called cohorts).

When a researcher buys a bundle, our system automatically tracks ownership and splits the payment among all contributors—so every user gets rewarded.

We use blockchain behind the scenes for fairness, transparency, and simple automated payouts—but users just see an easy web app, no crypto or wallets required.
